Reflection on Course Projects
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The primary problem tackled in these projects was to create a course planner application capable of loading, displaying, and managing course data efficiently. This involved reading course information from a file, displaying a list of courses in an organized manner, and providing detailed information about specific courses, including their prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The problem was approached by breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks and selecting appropriate data structures to handle different aspects of the application. Understanding data structures was crucial for efficiently organizing and accessing the course data. The use of an unordered map (hash table) allowed for quick lookups of course information, while vectors and sorting algorithms ensured the course list could be displayed in alphanumeric order. These choices were made to balance efficiency in terms of time complexity for different operations.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Encountering roadblocks, such as parsing the input file correctly and managing user input, was addressed by iterating through the code development process, testing small parts of the code incrementally, and debugging as necessary. Breaking down the problem into smaller functions, such as loadCourses, printCourseList, and printCourseInfo, helped isolate issues and allowed for focused troubleshooting. Additionally, referring to documentation and seeking assistance from peers or online forums provided further insights and solutions to specific challenges.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project has broadened my approach to software design by emphasizing the importance of choosing the right data structures for the task at hand and structuring the code for modularity and readability. It highlighted the need for planning and designing software with both efficiency and maintainability in mind. Understanding the trade-offs between different data structures and their operations enabled me to make more informed decisions in software design.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project reinforced the importance of writing clean, maintainable, and adaptable code. By following best practices such as modularizing the code into smaller functions, using meaningful variable names, and adding comments where necessary, the code became easier to understand and maintain. Additionally, considering edge cases and ensuring the program could handle various input scenarios made the code more robust. The experience of balancing efficiency with readability has been invaluable in evolving my programming style to produce high-quality, maintainable software.
